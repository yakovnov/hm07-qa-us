# Sprint 7 project made by Yasha Novgorodsky
The project was about building an aoutomated tests for checking the url requests: POST, PUT, GET, DELETE
I checked if there is a package.json file created
To run these tests i installed the Jest library by command 'npm isntall'
All the tests were running by command "npx jest" from the hm07-qa-us folder
