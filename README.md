# Sprint 7 project made by Yasha Novgorodsky
I've checked if there Jest library installed in the project folder. If there are no package.json files i will use the 'hit init' command
After making changes in the files i executed the command 'git add -A' to stage the files 
I used 'git commit -m Project 7 final result' to make a commit of the files in the stage area
To add the modified files to the remote repository I used command "git push"
